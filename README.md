# Basic CRUD App with Node and React
Using this [guide](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/10/build-a-basic-crud-app-with-node-and-react), I created both a frontend web app in React and a backend REST API server in Node. The frontend has a home page and a posts manager, with the posts manager hidden behind secure user authentication. As an added security measure, the backend will also not let you create or edit posts unless youâ€™re properly authenticated.
